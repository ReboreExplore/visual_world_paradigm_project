# Information Instructions for the subjects.

## Pre-experiment questionnaire for the participants:
1. Are you wearing any kind of eye makeup like mascara or any sort of eye
gel?
2. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses?
3. Do you have any known eye disorders/diseases?
4. Do you wear any hearing aids or have any difficulty hearing?
5. Do you have at least a B2 level of English proficiency?
6. Are you ready for the experiment?

For the study coordinators:
1. Check if they have drooping eyelids visually.
2. ASk them to remove any accessories like scarf and tie their hair so that it doesnot interfere during experiment.
3. Have a approximate guess of their height.

## Information for the participants:

1. We have disinfected the place before the experiment so that you are not
vulnerable to any germs.
2. Eye tracking is non-evasive and no adverse side effects are known to
exist. In no part of the experiment, your eyes will be hurt.
3. The data collected in this experiment will only be used for academic
purposes within the University of Stuttgart without revealing your
identity at any stage of the research. The data will only be used with
the subject ids and not names.
4. In this experiment, we are not measuring your intellectual ability, eye
disorders, or mental disorders of any kind.
5. Also, it is just a study and you only need to follow the instructions.
There exists no pass or fail status for the experiment.
6. You may leave the experiment at any time without any repercussions or
reasons to leave. If you want to end the experiment early, press the
escape key followed by the ‘q’ key.
7. You can also choose to take a break in between the trials by simply
raising your hand. One trial usually lasts for about 15 seconds.
8. We also have our contact details in the manual so if you have any
concerns about the experiment you can reach out to us later.
9. We would request you try to sit straight during the experiment so that
the data is captured correctly. If you move, we have to stop and
recalibrate the eye tracker.
10. **About the experiment**: In this experiment, you will be shown four line
drawings on the screen and you will have to click on the line drawing of
the object you hear in the audio prompt. The first step will be to
calibrate your eye with this eye tracker, and this step can be repeated
in between the experiment if you move or change your posture. For this
step, you just need to follow the calibration instructions, and as it is
not a part of the experiment we will help you do it. Then the experiment
screen will show up. You will be asked to fixate on the center of the
screen at the start and end of each trial. By trial, we mean each sample
or object we ask you to focus and by fixate we mean we want you to look
at a certain point on the screen. Before you hear your audio prompt to
fixate, the four line drawings will already be visible to you so you can
look around freely, explore the line drawings, and maybe recall what
those are called. Then you will be asked to click on one of the objects
on the screen. One trial will take approximately say 15-20 secs.
We will give you a short practice task to get used to the experiment
structure.
11. Do you have any questions so far?
12. If you are ready for the experiment, we require you to sign the consent
form. You can take your time to go through it.

## Post-experiment questionnaire for the participants:
1. Could you guess the purpose of the study?
2. If not, we brief them on the goal.
3. Ask for feedback, like if there were typos or, stimuli were unclear, was
it too long, etc.
