abstract: The study presented in this paper explores the dynamics of predictive language processing through the visual world paradigm (VWP), a widely employed method in cognitive psychology. The primary objective of the research is to unwind how individuals anticipate or predict forthcoming words during the unfolding of the spoken instructions, leveraging the Gazepoint eye tracker for precise gaze pattern analysis. The investigation delves into the impact of competitor words on gaze patterns, to study the cognitive mechanisms underlying real-time language comprehension. Our experiment uses a collection of competitor words sharing phonetic or semantic similarities with the target, and validates the hypothesis that the existence of such competitors leads to an increased number of fixations on them, reflecting the participants' evolving predictions of the upcoming word.

# Introduction

## Visual World Paradigm

The visual world paradigm is an experimental framework that investigates language processing by monitoring participants' eye movements while they interact with visual stimuli. Introduced by psychologists Richard Cooper and Thomas P. McDermott in the late 1990s, this paradigm have been continuosly refined and expanded, adapting it to different research questions and using advancements in eye-tracking technology to gain deeper insights into real-time language comprehension and visual attention processes. Through this framework the researchers try to simulate the integration of spoken language and visual information as they naturally occur in everyday situations so that we can draw inferences on the attention focus on specific objects in their visual display over time. 

## Objective of our project
Our research question is: 

\emph{Does the presence of similar-sounding words influence our tendency to focus on those words apart from the target word as the word unfolds?}


Our project is to study the nature of spoken word recognition as the word unfolds. We try to investigate the visual world paradigm by using the participants' eye movements which serve as an index of their ongoing language processing and interpretation. We dive deeper in trying to understand how the participants predict the upcoming word in a spoken instruction and how the cognitive mechanisms underlying real-time language comprehension influence their gaze patterns. 

We aim to explore two fundamental conclusions concerning spoken word recognition and the underlying models, based upon the established research in this domain: 

- Spoken word recognition is dynamic in nature which suggests that listeners continuously update and refine their interpretations as more information becomes available. It is not a discrete process rather it is a continuous process that unfolds over time.
- Spoken word recognition models make assumptions that multiple candidates compete for recognition during the unfolding of the spoken word.

Paul D.Allopenna, James S. Magnuson and  Michael K. Tanenhaus in their paper \enquote{Tracking the Time Course of Spoken Word Recognition Using Eye Movements: Evidence for Continuous Mapping Models} investigated a similar structure of the experiment and found the following results: 

![Probability of fixating on each item type over time in the full competitor condition](img/ref_graph.png){#fig-matrix width=90%}

In this figure we have the probability of fixation on four words:

1. Referent (e.g., beaker): Target Word
2. Cohort (e.g., beetle): Similar Sounding Word
3. Rhyme (e.g., speaker): Rhyming word
4. Unrelated (e.g., carriage): Unrelated word to the rest (phonetically or semantically.)

In the beginning the participants hear [bi], which could be the beginning of *beaker* but also could be the beginning of *beetle*. So during the first 400 ms the particpants start looking at both of those words, more than they look at the others. After some time as they hear the [k] i.e. now they are hearing [bik], thus they discard their choice of *beetle* and stop looking at it. But by the time they've heard the whole word *beaker*, they might realize that *beaker* rhymes almost exactly with *speaker* and get confused about if they heard *speaker* at the very first place. For the last word carriage the pronunciation is totally unrelated to the target *beaker*, so there is a very less probability of the participant actually fixation at the unrelated word.

Through we try to replicate the  results obtained by Paul D.Allopenna, James S. Magnuson and  Michael K. Tanenhaus in their paper \enquote{Tracking the Time Course of Spoken Word Recognition Using Eye Movements: Evidence for Continuous Mapping Models} and validate their hypothesis.

# Experiment 

## Software and Hardware

- **Software**: The experiment is designed in [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/) which is a open source software to create experiments for psychology, neuroscience, and experimental economics. 

- **Language**: Python was used along with the OpenSesame GUI to create the experiment. Libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib were used to analyze the data. For backend processing in the OpenSesame GUI, PsychoPy was used.

- **Eye Tracker**: The experiment is conducted using the GazePoint GP3+ eye tracker. It is a binocular eye tracker that can record at 150 Hz  The eye tracker is connected to the computer and the participants are seated at a distance of 60 cm from the screen. The experiment was conducted in a dimly lit laboratory setup to avoid any external light source that might interfere with the eye tracking.

## Structure of the Stimulus

The experiment is designed to test the participants' ability to predict the upcoming word in a spoken instruction. The experiment is designed in such a way that the participants are presented with a visual display of four objects in a grid and they are instructed to click on the object that matches the spoken instruction.

A trial in the experiment means the response to one spoken instruction.

The following User Interface is presented to the participants:

![User Interface of one trial - In each trial we have a 3x3 grid structure with four objects in it. Each trial has four stimulus displayed. The four stimulus are a combination of referent, cohort, rhyme and unrelated words. All or atleast two of the combinations are present in each trial according to the condition set (Full competitor, Rhyme competitor, Unrelated competitor etc.), which will be referred in the later part of the report. The stimulus used are only line drawings of the objects, to remove anmibuity in the visual display. The dot in the center grid is the fixation point for the participants.](img/stim_grid.png){#fig-ui width=70%}

## Design of the Experiment

The experiment follows the following structure in OpenSesame:

1. **Introduction to the experiment**: It contains some preliminary instructions for the participants to understand the experiment. It also mentions that each progression will require a mouse click. The foreground color of the text is set to black and the background color is set to white throughout the experiment.

![Introduction](img/intro_script.png){#fig-ui width=50%}

2. **Initialization of variables**: The position variables (Top, Buttom, Left and Right) are initialized and are used to set the position of the objects in the grid. The pygaze module is also intialized to record the eye movements of the participants.

3. **Trial Loop Items**: This loop runs the experiment for 24 trials. The trial loop contains the following sequence of events:
    - **Fixation Cross**: A fixation cross is displayed at the center of the screen. The fixation cross is a black dot on a white background. The fixation cross is displayed to ensure that the participants are looking at the center of the screen before the spoken instruction is played. The fixation cross is displayed using the sketchpad item in OpenSesame.
    
    - **Stimulus**: 
        1. The visual stimulus for each trial is loaded from the `stimuli.csv` file. The csv file contains information about the four objects that are displayed in the grid. The csv file contains the following information:
            - **Stimulus**: The name of the objects that is displayed in the grid.
            - **Type**: The type of the object. The type can be referent, cohort, rhyme or unrelated. The type of the object is used to determine the condition of the trial.
            - **Condition**: The condition of the trial.
            - **Target**: The target object that the participants have to click on.
            You can find the stimuli.csv file [here](https://github.com/ReboreExplore/visual_world_paradigm_project/blob/main/stimuli/stimuli-final.csv).
        2. We also have accompaning audio stimuli for each trial. The audio is digitally recorded. The audio stimuli are recorded in the following format:
            - **Instruction**: 'FixateHow to run the analysisbject that the participants have to click on.
            You can find the audio stimuli [here](https://github.com/ReboreExplore/visual_world_paradigm_project/blob/main/stimuli/audio-stimuli).
            Each response is captured with a mouse click. The mouse click is recorded and logged using the mouse_response item in OpenSesame.
    
    - **Logging**: The onset and offset of the fixation cross and the stimulus (both audio and visual) is logged for each trail. We also log the position of the mouse click and the target object along with its position (top,right, buttom, left) that the participants clicked on. (_More details will be proviided in the preprocessing and analysis section_.)
    
    - **Gaze Contingency**: Two fixation audio prompts which says _'Fixate at the center'_ and '_Now fixate at the center_' and marks the beginning and end of one trail.The fixation audio prompt is played to ensure that the participants are looking at the center of the screen before the spoken instruction is played. This is implemented by introducing a delay of 1.1s after the prompt. 
    ![Timeline of a trial](img/trial_timeline.png){#fig-ui width=90%}

4. **End of Experiment**: The experiment ends with a thank you message for the participants.

## Logic of the experiment

1. Stimuli are chosen as per the different pairs of sets included in the reference paper by Paul D.Allopenna, James S. Magnuson and  Michael K. Tanenhaus.
    - For e.g., One criteria of choosing those words are based on frequency per million words in the Kucera and Francis, 1967, corpus.

2. A fixation at any point on the screen indicates that the participant is paying attention to it. Thus we record the fixations throughout the experiment to deduce the attention of the pariticipant when we instruct them to fixate or look at a certain point of the canvas.

3. Noting timestamps of the samples is essential. Our experiment is designed to record how a participants attends to the stimuli and how they respond to the spoken instruction while the instruction is unfolding. Thus we record the timestamps of the samples to understand the chronology of the fixation events.

4. Fixations at the centre of the screen marks the start and end of a trial. This is to make sure we don't overlap the data of two trials while recording the data since each participant will have different response times and thus a fixed duration for each trial for timeout will not be feasible.

# Stimulus Design


# Stimuli Preprocessing
The stimuli collected needed to be preprocessed before they could be used in the experiment. The preprocessing steps are as follows:

1. Resizing the line drawings into 256x256 pixels. The OpenCV library was was used to read and resize the images.
        
    ```python
    img = cv2.resize(img, size)
    ```

2. Converting the audio files to ```.wav``` format. The audio files were generated in ```.mp3``` format. The 
        
    ```bash
        for file in $DIRPATH/*.mp3; do
            filename=$(basename "$file")
            filename="${filename%.*}"
            ffmpeg -i $file $OUTDIR/$filename.wav
        done
    ```

3. A trailing silence after each audio was observed which would affect the response time of the participants. The silence was removed using the ```pydub``` library.
        
    ```python
        def detect_leading_silence(sound, silence_threshold, chunk_size=10):
            trim_ms = 0 # ms
            while sound[trim_ms:trim_ms+chunk_size].dBFS < silence_threshold:
                trim_ms += chunk_size
            return trim_ms
    ```
The function analyzes an audio snippet to find the duration of the silence at the beginning of the signal. It iterates over chunks of the audio and measuring the volume (dBFS) in each chunk until the volume exceeds the provided silence threshold. The accumulated time of trimmed silence is then returned as the result and then removed using the ```sound[trim_ms:]``` function, spectifying the start and the end trim duration.

4. The sampling rate of all the audio samples was also made equal to work with the ```PsychoPy``` backend. The sampling rate was changed to 48Hz.

# Challenges and Limitations

## What we did not replicate from the reference paper?

1. Average duration of auditory stimulus was changed from 375 ms to 750 ms. It was done to as it was more comprehensible for the participants.
    - The average duration was calculated by taking the average of the duration of all the audio stimuli which can be found [here](https://github.com/ReboreExplore/visual_world_paradigm_project/blob/main/docs/analysis).

2. Number of trials for each participant was reduced from 96 to 24. It was done to reduce the time of the experiment and to avoid recalibration of the eye tracker in between the experiment.

3. Audio stimuli were digital (instead of analog). It was done to avoid any noise in the audio stimuli and also to have no influence of the experimenterś accent on the participants.

4. Participants respond with mouse clicks instead of _drag-and-drop to the correct box_ function as does not support drag-and-drop functionality.

5. Use of a 3x3 grid instead of 5x5 as we didin't require the additional boxes for the drag-and-drop functionality as in the original paper.

6. No calibration functionality after each trial was added until the participant was moving their head or eyes too much.


## Challenges
    
1. **Balancing of trials**: 
    - **Challenge**: Our stimuli had a total of _23 unique` visual stimuli_, _12 different conditions_ and _4 different types_. Adhering to proper randomization and balancing of trials was a challenge as we had to ensure that each participant saw the same number of trials for each condition and each type and such that each object appeared equal number of times. 
    - **Solution**: Although we started tith a python script to generate the trials, we had to revert to manual creation of trials as the script was not able to generate balanced trials which was a primary requirement for our experiment.

2. **Random ‘freezes’ during experiment** : 
    - **Challenge**: The experiment encountered random freezes during its run. The freezes were random and could not be reproduced. This was a major challenge as we had to restart the experiment from the beginning. The most frequent freezes was found on the _gaze contingency_ check, which allowed the experiment to move forward only when the participant was looking at the center of the screen.
    
    - **Trials**: 

        1. While True loop
        ```python
            while True:
            gazepos = eyetracker.sample()
        ```
        2. Periodic sampling
        ```python
		    while True:
                if clock.time() - check_timer > diff:
                    gazepos = eyetracker.sample()
        ```
        3. Switching backend to PsychoPy
                Made the sample rates of all the audio samples equal to work with the PsychoPy backend.
        
        4. Number of trials
                Reduced the number of trials to 24 from 12 to reduce the time of the experiment but the problem still persisted.

    - **Solution**: Removal of gaze contingent features and instead introducing a delay to ensure that the participants are looking at the center of the screen before the spoken instruction is played. This was implemented by introducing a delay of 1.1s after the prompt.

3. **Eye tracker calibration**:
    - **Challenge**: The eye tracker calibration was a challenge as the participants were not able to calibrate the eye tracker properly, due to many reasons like contact lenses, glasses, height of the participants, body posture during the experiment etc. 
    - **Solution**: THe number of participants were increased to 16 to ensure that we have atleast 12 participants with proper calibration and the timing of one full experiment was reduced to a maximum of 8 minutes to avoid recalibration in between the experiments. The participants were also given a practice trial to ensure that they are comfortable with the experiment and the eye tracker calibration.

## Limitations

1. Since Visual World Paradigm is a well known experimental framework, it is possible that the participants might have been aware of the purpose of the experiment and thus might have been biased in their responses despite the large number of filler trials. Also, we used a relatively small set of pictures, which might have led to a learning effect i.e the participants might have been able to predict the target word based on the previous trials.

2. Generalizability is affected as our study participants only include university students of a specific age group, which does not fully represent the complexities and variations of real-world spoken word recognition scenarios. The results may not be applicable to other age groups or people with different educational backgrounds who might have more or less exposure to the  field of cognitive psychology.

3. The study also may not fully address the universality of the observed effects across different languages as the original study as well as our replication is in English.


# Conclusion
In this project we attempted to investigate the dynamics of predictive language processing through the visual world paradigm. We tried to replicate the experiment conducted by Paul D. Allopenna, James S. Magnuson and  Michael K. Tanenhaus in their paper \enquote{Tracking the Time Course of Spoken Word Recognition Using Eye Movements: Evidence for Continuous Mapping Models} and validate the hypothesis that the existence of similar sounding words leads to an increased number of fixations on them, reflecting the participants' evolving predictions of the upcoming word. We were able to replicate the results of the original study and thus validate the hypothesis, keeping into account the limitations of our study.

We summarize our conclusions as follows:

1. The inclusion of semantically or phonetically similar words in the spoken instructions results in a higher frequency of fixations on the visual images of the words. This phenomenon illustrates how participants are continuously adjusting their predictions for the upcoming word as they engage with the content.

2. Eye movement tracking is a reliable tool for investigating the time course of spoken word recognition and capturing the mapping process while the spoken word unfolds.

3. The results and plots obtained by us provide an empirical support for continuous and incremental mapping models of word recognition and proves that word processing is not a discrete and all-or-nothing process.

4. Our results suggest that as the spoken word unfolds over time, the listener gradually narrows down the set of candidate words based on the contextual information. This competition among candidate words occurs until a single word is identified or a clear winner emerges.
