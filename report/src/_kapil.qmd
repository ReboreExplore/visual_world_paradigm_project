# Stimulus Design and Preprocessing

## Visual Stimuli
For our study, we required uncomplicated and easily comprehensible stimuli to ensure easy understanding for the participants. Therefore, we opted for line drawing images as our chosen type of images. We sourced these stimuli with a Creative Commons License BY-SA, obtaining them from online platforms. In cases where certain line drawings were not directly accessible, we employed an edge detection algorithm within the GIMP software to create the desired line drawing stimuli. Each individual stimulus measures 256 x 256 pixels and is saved in PNG format. The @fig-pickle-stim illustrates an example of the stimuli used in our experiment.

We selected similar stimuli as the reference paper for our experiment. The experiment uses eight _referent - cohort - rhyme - unrelated_ sets which are listed below:

1. beaker, beetle, speaker, dolphin
2. carrot, carriage, parrot, nickel
3. candle, candy, handle, dollar
4. pickle, picture, nickel, speaker
5. casket, castle, basket,nickel
6. paddle, padlock, saddle, dollar
7. dollar, dolphin, collar, beaker
8. sandal, sandwich, candle, parrot

## Auditory Stimuli {#sec-gen-audio}
As outlined in the referenced paper, during the course of the experiment, the examiner verbally provided instructions to each participant for every trial, such as 'click on the [beaker]' However, this approach could potentially consume a significant amount of time and introduce errors, as the duration taken by the examiner to vocalize the stimulus name and instructions might differ for various participants. To prevent potential errors stemming from variations in the examiner's delivery speed, (digital) synthetic audio stimuli were generated that audibly articulated both the stimulus names and the associated actions to be performed. To facilitate this process, the website [acoust.io](https://www.acoust.io/) was employed to create the audio stimuli. The below listed configuration was used to ensure the uniformity of the generated audio stimuli:

1. Voice Profile: DAVIS
2. Playback speed: 0.8x
3. Sampling rate: 48Hz (relevant for use with `psychoPy` backend in OpenSesame)
